# TODO-list
My CRUD app is useful to organise your daily tasks.

I used RESTful API to manage my list, GET(), POST(), PUT(), DELETE() methods

Used typeScript version "^5.1.3"
Used eslint": "^8.42.0" and other TypeScript/eslint devDependencies
Used express version 4.17.1 as a dependency (Module)

I did not used variables environment in this project
