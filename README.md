# TODO-list
my CRUD app helps you organise your daily tasks.


Used RESTful API to achieve the CRUD process
Used Typescript version "^5.1.3" and "eslint": "^8.42.0" as DevDependencies and also some typescript/eslint devdependencies to parse the code and display errors if exist.
Used express version "^4.17.1" as a dependency or module
Used "@types/express" devdependency to be able to use types when it come to express variables like (req, res ..)
I did not used variable environment as I keep it simple, always secure.
used middleware


To run the app: 
the script : "start": "tsc && node dist/app.js"
in Terminal we just write : npm start

Note: nodemon is very handy to run the server automatically after any change => SHOULD be used
